                Adventure Time[c] is an American fantasy animated television series created by Pendleton
                 Ward and co-produced by Frederator Studios for Cartoon Network. The series follows the 
                 adventures of a boy named Finn (Jeremy Shada) and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake 
                 (John DiMaggio)—a dog with the power to change size and shape at will.
                <br> <br>
                The series drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including the fantasy role-playing game 
                Dungeons & Dragons and video games. It was produced using hand-drawn animation; action and dialogue
                 for episodes are decided by storyboarding artists based on rough outlines. Because each episode took
                  roughly eight to nine months to complete, multiple episodes were worked on concurrently. The cast members 
                  recorded their lines in group recordings
